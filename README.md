I define myself as a curious and eclectic Engineer.

I'm a Sound Engineer, and as such, I started working on maintenance for audio equipment at Canal 13 in Chile.
By circumstances, I moved internally, and stated playing with network equipment and open source (mostly on linux) 
a lot. So much, that I decided to study again, this time, Computer Engineering.

When I was about to finish my second career, I moved to the ALMA telescope. There, I became a member of the proposal handling team
-fancy name to select which projects to observe each year-. 
I was eager to learn, so I moved from the science department to the computing department, and started to work as 
a testing engineer. Once again, circumstances, luck and talent took me to lead a team of good software engineers 
responsible for delivering the control framework for the telescope. I had the opportunity to transition the control framework from
Europe to Chile, and the fortune of leading the team while we developed and then delivered the software
version used to couple ALMA to the Event Horizon Telescope and observe a black hole for the first time.
By this time, I obtained my Master's degree in Industrial Engineering.
I was also lead of another great team, pushing to adopt the DevOps culture internally: we implemented containerization, observability, and automated a bunch of manual processes.

Then, I moved to the Data Observatory, where we intended to democratize access to computing power
and data for Chile. We ported the ALMA regional center to the cloud, but most importantly, we designed, implemented
and maintained the Covid 19 date repository for the Chilean Ministry of Science, Technology and Knowledge, Recognized by the OMS as one of the most open
data repositories worldwide.

Later, I moved to Comscore, where I worked with an amazing team and grew as DevOps Engineer, helping migrating workloads to the cloud.

Afterwards, I joined Sovos, where I lead a team responsible for closing gaps between Developers and Operations, shortening time to market for commits, while
also pushing kubernetes and cloud adoption.

Then, I was a DevOps engineer at Zerofox, a company with the greatest culture I've experienced. I played the role of a Scrum master for the DevSecOps team,
implementing features aiming to tackle security concerns.

And now, I'm an Infrastructure Engineer at Shiftmove, where culture is as good as it can get :). But the biggest change was weather and language!
 
And since 2019, I'm also the CTO and software ninja for EmbedX (former Perk.cl), a chilean startup, working to simplify and democratize access to insurance.
