I'm a former Sound Engineer, then Software Engineer, and last but not least, a MEng in Industrial Engineering.
 
I enjoy helping people build solutions: I've worked implementing open source solutions at Canal 13 in Chile and its 
media asset manager, then moved on to work on supporting astronomers to build a ranking of projects to observe using the
ALMA telescope. Later, jumped to test software, and lead a team of talented developers to maintain the control 
framework for the telescope. Currently, I'm working at the Data Observatory, democratizing data and compute power.

I've opened 31 issues throughout this time.

Also, I've contributed with 139 pull requests.

In terms of  commits, there are 1651 commits.

These contributions are distributed amongst 12 repos.
