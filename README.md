I'm a former Sound Engineer, then Software Engineer, and last but not least, a MEng in Industrial Engineering.
 
I enjoy helping people build solutions: I've worked implementing open source solutions at Canal 13 in Chile and its 
media asset manager, then moved on to work on supporting astronomers to build a ranking of projects to observe using the
ALMA telescope. Later, jumped to test software, and lead a team of talented developers to maintain the control 
framework for the telescope. Afterwards, I worked at the Data Observatory, democratizing data access and compute power, where 
we designed Minstry of Science's open platform to publis COVID-19 data, and then I devoted some time as volunteer to maintain it.
Then, I was lucky enough to land a work with an amazing team at ComScore, where I developed myself as a Senior DevOps Engineer.
And currently, I work as a Principal DevOps engineer at Sovos, as a member of a team closing gaps between developers and operations teams, providing reliability to our systems.

And I'm also a software ninja for Perk, a chilean Startup, working to democratize access to insurance.
