I'm a former Sound Engineer, then Software Engineer, and last but not least, a MEng in Industrial Engineering.
 
I enjoy helping people build solutions: I've worked implementing open source solutions at Canal 13 in Chile and its 
media asset manager, then moved on to work on supporting astronomers to build a ranking of projects to observe using the
ALMA telescope. Later, jumped to test software, and lead a team of talented developers to maintain the control 
framework for the telescope: I was in charge of the team delivering the first software version used to make ALMA a part of the 
Event Horizon Telescope, and observe for the first time a black hole's event horizon.
Afterwards, I worked at the Data Observatory, democratizing data access and compute power for Chile, where 
we designed Ministry of Science's open platform to publish COVID-19 data, and then I devoted some time as volunteer to maintain it.
Then, I was lucky enough to land a work with an amazing team at ComScore, where I developed myself as a Senior DevOps Engineer.
Afterwards, I worked as a Principal DevOps engineer at Sovos, leading a team closing gaps between developers and operators, providing
reliability, repeatability and reproducibility to the processes.
Right now I'm working in cybersecurity, as a Senior DevOps engineer paving a way to DevSecOps.

And I'm also the CTO and software ninja for EmbedX (former Perk.cl), a chilean startup, working to simplify and democratize access to insurance.
