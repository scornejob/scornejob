I'm a former Sound Engineer, then Software Engineer, and last but not least, a MEng in Industrial Engineering.
 
I enjoy helping people build solutions: I've worked implementing open source solutions at Canal 13 in Chile and its 
media asset manager, then moved on to work on supporting astronomers to build a ranking of projects to observe using the
ALMA telescope. Later, jumped to test software, and lead a team of talented developers to maintain the control 
framework for the telescope. Currently, I'm working at the Data Observatory, democratizing data access and compute power.
